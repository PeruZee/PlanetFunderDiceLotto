# The First: 50/50 Lotto Dice

1. The dice is rolled as many times as there are participants.
2. The dice has as many sides as there are participants. 
3. The lottery is choice-less and held every 12 hours (720 minutes).
4. 10% Loser cashback. 50% Winner pool. 5% Monthly Donation Funds (60%: paid out instantly + 5% Donation Funds transferred at the end of each month).

**[Example 1: 10d10]** 

If there are 10 participants, the die will have 10 sides with numbers ranging from 1-10 and each of the participants will also roll the die 10 times individually. Their 10 rolls are totalled and compared against other participants total roll value to give them a standing. There can be ties.

**[Example 2: 100d100]** 

If there are 100 participants, the die will have 100 sides with numbers ranging from 1-100 and each of the participants will also roll the die 100 times individually. Their 100 rolls are totalled and compared against other participants total roll value to give them a standing. There can be ties.

**2x100-Sided Dice: 2d100**
